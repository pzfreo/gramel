Purfling cutter — parametric model.

Single source of truth for every dimension that crosses a part boundary.
Each numeric field carries spec_ref, status (ESTIMATE | MEASURED | DERIVED),
and units in json_schema_extra.

Wall thicknesses around the four critical bore / slot features (§4.2.13,
§4.2.14, §4.3.23, §4.3.24, §4.3.25) are **derived** from the surrounding
geometry, exposed as computed properties on PurflingCutterParams, and
validated against the spec's minimum-thickness rules. A caller cannot claim a
wall thickness inconsistent with the geometry.
