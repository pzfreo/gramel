"""
Shank — the square brass body that doubles as the fence.

Coordinate convention (Z-up, intuitive for holding the tool):
  Z: along the shank, +Z = top (drive screw / thumbwheel end).
     Bottom of shank (depth-lock knob) at Z = 0.
  X: along the shaft AND normal to the working face. +X = working face
     direction. The shaft passes through the working face out toward the
     workpiece. Edge-margin adjustment translates the shaft in X.
  Y: perpendicular to both. Tool-travel direction (along the violin edge).

Blades cut downward in −Z when the tool is in use.

This draft uses *smooth* bores (no thread geometry yet) and a single
fillet radius applied to all external edges as the finishing layer.
