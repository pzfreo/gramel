"""
Shaft — brass bar passing horizontally through the shank's crossbore,
carrying the blades at its outboard end.

Coordinate convention (matches the shank — Z-up):
  X: along the shaft. +X = right end (carries the blade slot, near
     the workpiece). −X = left end (outboard, drive-plate end).
  Y: perpendicular to shaft, horizontal (tool-travel direction).
  Z: vertical (depth-of-cut direction). Blades drop down in −Z.

Features:
  - Round cross-section of diameter ``params.shaft_outer_diameter``
    (derived from ``cutting_pair.nominal_diameter``).
  - Flat machined on the underside (−Z) over a central X span — the
    depth-lock push rod registers against this flat.
  - Blade slot near the +X end: open through Z, with X extent =
    blade_slot_width and Y extent = blade_slot_length.
  - Grub-screw end tap (smooth bore at tap-drill diameter for now)
    in the +X end face, along X.
  - Two tapped holes in the −X end face (for the drive plate),
    spaced in Z, along X.

Threads on the grub-screw tap and the drive-plate mount holes come
later — this draft just leaves smooth bores at tap-drill diameter.
