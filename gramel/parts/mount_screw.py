"""
Drive-plate mount screw — the small M2 fastener that holds the drive plate
to the shaft's −X end face. Passes through the plate's mount clearance
hole, through the tenon (which sits in the shaft's end slot), and threads
into the M2 tap on the shaft's end face.

Local frame:
  X: along the screw axis. X = 0 = head's outboard (−X) face;
     +X = inboard (toward the shaft).
