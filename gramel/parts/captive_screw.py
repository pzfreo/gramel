"""
Captive (retaining) screw — the small stock M2 fastener for the journal
bearing. It threads into the deep tap down the bearing journal's centre and
clamps the retaining washer against the journal end face. The bearing axial
play is set by the journal length (not by this screw), so the screw can be
torqued fully.

Local frame:
  X: along the screw axis. X = 0 = head's outboard (−X) face;
     +X = inboard (toward the thumbwheel).
