"""
Helpers for building real ISO helical threads via bd_warehouse.IsoThread.

Only used on the **FDM prototype path** (process.prototype = True), where
the printed plastic mechanism has to physically engage. For the CNC
production path the parts stay as clean cylinders + drawing callouts —
that's the contract a machine shop reads, not the helical geometry.

Two helpers:
  - external_thread_section: a screw-shaft chunk (core cylinder + helix).
  - internal_thread_cutout: the *void* shape for a tapped bore — the
    clearance bore at thread major diameter minus the helical ribs.
    Caller subtracts this from the host part.

Both are built along +Z in their local frame; caller applies placement.
