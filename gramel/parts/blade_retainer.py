"""
Bone-shaped copper retainer. Four per tool, sit in the blade slot to
hold the blade-spacer-blade stack in place along the slot's X direction.

Local frame:
  X: thickness (0.85 mm). Plate's normal direction.
  Y: width — varies along the bone profile: 5.5 mm at the ends, 4.5 mm
     in the middle.
  Z: long axis (10 mm). Bone profile is symmetric about Z = 0.

Three stacked rectangles (top knob + waist + bottom knob), then the
four outermost X-axis edges (the outside corners of each knob end) are
filleted to match the rounded ends of the measured original.
