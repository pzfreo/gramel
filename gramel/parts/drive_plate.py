"""
Drive plate — small brass plate that stands vertically up from the shaft's
outboard end, transmits drive screw translation to the shaft via the
captive-screw bearing at its thumb end.

Coordinate convention (plate's local frame):
  X: plate normal — thickness direction. +X = "back" (faces the shaft),
     −X = "front" (faces outboard, where the captive-screw head sits).
  Y: horizontal across the plate.
  Z: vertical. Origin (Z = 0) is the shaft-end boss centre; the thumb-end
     boss centre sits at Z = crossbore_to_tapped_bore_gap.

Outline: **egg shape** — larger circle (shaft_end_radius) at Z = 0,
smaller circle (thumb_end_radius) at Z = gap, connected by external
tangent lines.

Holes:
  - Central mount-screw clearance hole at the shaft end (Z = 0).
  - Captive-screw clearance hole at the thumb end (Z = gap).

Anti-rotation: small rectangular tenon projecting from the back face
(+X face) at Z = 0, sized to engage a matching slot in the shaft's
−X end face. The tenon + slot pair prevents the plate from rotating
around the mount-screw axis; the screw itself holds the parts axially.
The tenon is on the plate (not the shaft) so the plate keeps full
thickness in the load-bearing region.
