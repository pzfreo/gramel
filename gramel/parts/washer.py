"""
Retaining washer for the drive-screw journal bearing — stock M2 flat washer.

The captive screw clamps this washer against the bearing journal's end face;
its outer diameter overhangs the drive plate's bearing hole and retains the
plate on the journal. Its thickness does not affect the bearing play.

Local frame:
  X: washer axis (washer lies in the YZ plane). X = 0 is the centre.
