Grub screw — threaded into the shaft's +X end tap to clamp the
blade-spacer-blade-retainers stack.

Local frame:
  X: along the screw axis. X = 0 = +X (outer) face; +X points inboard.

Modelled as a plain cylinder at the thread's major diameter, length =
grub_screw.length. Slot / hex drive head not modelled.
